You are going to add a text file with a unique identifier to your repo
The unique identifier should be: the first letter of youxr first name (capitalized) + the first letter of your last name (capitalized) + the last 2 digits of your Student ID (PID). The main thing here is that the PID digits are correct!
For example, John Smith - A12345678 should submit 'JS78.txt'.
If you have a longer name, for example Marisol Mendoza y Garcia von Hohenzollern with PID A8765432 then you submit MMGH32.txt
The contents of this file do not matter (it can be empty).
Add this file to your cloned repository (the folder on your computer).
Note: A 'txt' file is a plain text file. It should have the extension '.txt'. You may need to specify, in your preferred text editor, to save this filetype.
